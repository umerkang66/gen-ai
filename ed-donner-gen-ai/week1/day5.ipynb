      "Open LLMs are enabling awesome downstream collaborations in AI research and development, but have you ever wondered about collaboration that happens before open weights are released? \n",
      "\n",
      "Excited to share a new paper with\n",
      "Johan Linåker\n",
      ",\n",
      "Jennifer Ding\n",
      ", and\n",
      "Ben Burtenshaw\n",
      "in which we map collaboration throughout the lifecycle of open LLMs, from the earliest moments in pre-training to downstream development by/with the community. To do so, we interviewed developers from 14 major open LLM projects from grassroots initiatives, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies across North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. \n",
      "\n",
      "💡 Key takeaways: \n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣  Collaboration on open LLMs doesn’t just start once weights are released. Instead collaborations take place throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, and in fact they extend far beyond the LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets (e.g. training, finetuning, alignment), open source frameworks (across the AI stack), eval strategies, leaderboards, knowledge-sharing forums, and compute partnerships, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣  Open LLM developers have lots of interesting social, economic, and technological motivations for doing what they do. These include democratising AI access, expanding language representation, fostering digital sovereignty, building regional ecosystems that can compete with dominant global players, promoting open science, and standardising tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣  Open LLM projects are organising themselves in different ways, with different approaches to the (de-)centralisation of control and community engagement. We identify and describe 5 approaches, including single company projects (e.g.\n",
      "Hugging Face\n",
      "’s SmolLM), research institute projects (e.g.\n",
      "Ai2\n",
      "’s OLMo 2), and grassroots projects (e.g.\n",
      "EleutherAI\n",
      "’s Pythia).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we hope this research helps to shed light on open source AI collaborations taking place around the world and spur future research. Huge thanks to all the developers who shared their time and insights with us and to everyone who provided feedback on earlier drafts! 🙏 \n",
